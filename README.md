Grey codes are binary numeral systems in which neighboring numbers have only one differing bit.
For converting a binary code to grey code, we simply record the MLB (Most Left Bit) as it is and
then, add MLB to its neighboring bit, record the sum and neglect the carry. Repeat the process.
The resulting number will be our grey code. This is how we convert binary code to grey code.
